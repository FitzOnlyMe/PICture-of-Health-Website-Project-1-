                "Hi My Name is Mark, im 33 Years old & met Leanne whilst we were working for ASDA 7 years ago. In the 5 years of mine and Leanne's relationship I have seen 1st hand the destruction that Macular diseases like PIC cause & the distress caused when treatment that works wonders for one person fails to make a dent on another person."

            <p>
                I have seen Leanne deal with anything from career changes, to pregnancy during a heat wave to having to spend a year indoors when Covid hit because of the <dfn title="medicines that lower immune system so organ transplants, for instance, aren't rejected">immunosuppressants</dfn> all while living with PIC & knowing that stress is a massive contributing factor in <dfn title="Sudden presentation of PIC symptoms">"Flair ups"</dfn> all of which has been, mostly, taken in her stride. If wisdom is truly gained through suffering then Leanne is a super genius.
