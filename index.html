                Sadly not a lot is currently know about PIC which makes diagnosis treatment very difficult, it is currently suspected of being associated/linked with <dfn title="your body's response to virus' or infections">auto immune responses</dfn>. What is known currently is that PIC <em> tends </em> to affect young, short-sighted women who will (commonly) experience:
                
                <br>

                <ol id="symptoms">
                    <p id ="prompt">
                    ** This is not an exhaustive list! **
                    </p>

                    <li> 
                        Blurred Vision (in one of both eyes) 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Warped Vision (Like fisheye lens)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flashing Lights
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Small Blinds spots in the central vision (because of the "White spots")
                    </li>

                <br>
                </ol>

                On top of this, between 25 - 30% of *ALL* patients develop <dfn title = "Choroidal neovascularizations">CNV's</dfn> <!--dfn is for definitions when hovered over(Like title)--> which are fragile new blood vessels that can break leaking blood and serum, causing retinal scarring and rapid loss of visual function.

            <h2 id="heading3"> How is P.I.C treated? </h2>
            <p class="paragraph3">
                One of the most commonly offered treatments for PIC is steroids (orally or via injection), the most prevalent of which is <a href ="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/prednisolone/"title ="Click for Further Information"target = "_blank">Prednisone</a> taken orally, initially at a high dose but then tapered down over the following weeks as the side effects of prolonged Prednisone usage can include:
            <br>

            <ol id="side_effects">
                <li> Insomnia </li>
                <li> Weight gain </li>
                <li> Depression </li>
                <br>
            </ol>

                It isn't just Predinsone that Ophthalmologists use in the continued fight against CNVs, another option is injections of <dfn title="Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor">anti VEGFs</dfn> Avastin (Lucentis previously but the efficacy is low against PIC) directly into the patient's eye. Avastin works well in this case because it blocks the VEGF (which is the body's process that is responsible for growing new blood vessels) thus saving vision!. They have prove extremely effetive in managing CNVs & have gone on to be used to stablise CNVs in other retinal diseases like <dfn title="Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration">"wet" AMD</dfn> which is  <a href="https://www.eyecenteroftexas.com/2021/01/wet-vs-dry-macular-degeneration/"title = "Click to visit website"target = "_blank">the number 1 cause of permanent central vision loss</a> 
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph4">
                Sadly despite the treatments on offer PIC still remains a relatively unknown disease with little mainstream exposure & little over a handful of specialists worldwide. Thankfully Places like the <a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/"title = "Click to visit website"target = "_blank">RNIB</a> and <a href="https://www.macularsociety.org/"title = "Click to visit website"target = "_blank">the Macular Society</a> are getting more mainstream exposure which in turn is helping raise further awareness of PIC and other <dfn title="The part of your retina responsible for clear vision in your direct line of sight">macular</dfn> diseases.
